# Follow News for Drupal

Implements the "Follow" feature for Drupal-based newspaper websites by adding a custom interface on the Drupal Messaging and Notifications frameworks.

## Installing

You probably shouldn't. This module implements only what we needed for the Follow News project and nothing else, so it probably doesn't quite fulfill your needs. It may even be dangerous, since it makes certain assumptions that were OK for our needs (such as skipping access checks on some notification types) but that might not fit your site. Instead, read through the source code and use this module as a guide for creating your own custom notifications system.

If you still really want to install this, see CONFIGURE.md for instructions on setting up Messaging and Notifications.
